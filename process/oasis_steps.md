# Oasis Engineering — Ready Set Orange Workflow

> ⚠️ This guide explains the **Oasis Engineering workflow** for homeowners and builders using the Ready Set Orange program.  
> It is **separate from Orange County’s official process** and focuses on how we help you finalize County-issued plans into a **permit-ready package**.

## 🚀 Our 3-Step Process

### Step 1. Submit County Intake Form  
- Start by submitting your property details through Orange County’s official **Ready Set Orange Request Form**.  
- 🔒 Only the property owner can submit this form.  
- Once reviewed, the County will email you an approval notice and the selected plan set.  
- **To submit the form, follow this link**: [Ready Set Orange Request Form](https://www.ocfl.net/PlanningDevelopment/ReadySetOrange.aspx)
---

### Step 2. Send Us Your County Approval + Survey  
Forward to our team:  
1. The **County’s plan approval email**  
2. Your **property boundary & topo survey** (from a licensed surveyor)  

Optional: Send any truss package documents if already available (often provided by truss manufacturer).

### Step 3. Receive Permit-Ready Engineering Package  
Within **5–10 business days**, we deliver a sealed, site-specific engineering package including:  

- ✅ **Site Plan** — zoning data, proposed contours, finished floor elevation  
- ✅ **Grading & Drainage Plan** — lot slope + stormwater management per County requirements  
- ✅ **Structural Review & Stamp** — full plan review + Engineer of Record (EOR) certification  
- ✅ **Energy Calculations** — Manual J/S/D (HVAC) or Florida Energy Code compliance  
- ✅ **Product Approval Sheet** — Florida-approved windows, doors, roofing, etc.  
- ✅ **Truss Package Review** — review + approval of your supplier’s sealed truss package  

💡 **Flat Fee:** $1,999 (limited-time) — typically saves $2,000+ compared to full-service options.

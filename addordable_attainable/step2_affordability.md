# Step 2 — Certified Affordable / Attainable Housing (County Guide, Deep Dive)

> This guide expands on [**Orange County’s official Step 2**](https://www.ocfl.net/PlanningDevelopment/ReadySetOrange.aspx) in the Ready Set Orange process (the *optional* certification step). It explains **incentives, eligibility, documentation, timelines, and common pitfalls** for both **Attainable** and **Affordable** categories across **Rental** and **Homeownership** paths. For official direction, contact the County directly (AffordableHousing@ocfl.net, 407-836-5150).

## TL;DR
- **Step 2 is optional** but can unlock **expedited rezoning/planning/permitting**, and for **Affordable** projects, potential **fee reductions**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Attainable** and **Affordable** each have **Rental** and **Homeownership** tracks with **different AMI limits, price/rent caps, enforcement, and monitoring**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- You must fit **location** criteria (Targeted/Established Sectors + place types) and meet **affordability periods** with **recorded agreements** (LURA/deed restrictions/MOU). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## What “Targeted” & “Established” Sectors Mean (and how to check)

Orange County’s **Vision 2050** framework directs most new growth to appropriate areas. “**Targeted Sectors**” are higher-population corridors (e.g., I-Drive, near UCF, Semoran Blvd., near downtown Orlando). “**Established Sectors**” emphasize retaining neighborhood character. Projects must also align with the listed **place types** (Neighborhood Center Low, Suburban Neighborhood, Suburban Mixed Neighborhood, Suburban Corridor). To verify your parcel:  
- Review **Vision 2050** sector info and place types. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Use County **Interactive Mapping / OCFL Atlas** to inspect parcel location and designations. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## AMI 101 — How Income Limits Work (with 2025 examples)

**Area Median Income (AMI)** varies by **household size** and **year**. Check the latest County income limit charts. For 2025 (CDBG-DR reference), the **Orange County AMI = $98,100** (family), with 120% AMI and other tiers published by household size. Examples:  
- **Household of 4** → **120% AMI = $126,500**  
- **Household of 2** → **120% AMI = $101,200**  
Use these to confirm eligibility under **Attainable** (120–140% AMI bands) or **Affordable** (≤60% AMI, with averaging up to 80%). Always confirm the most current chart before applying. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

> Tip: For **Affordable Homeownership**, the **sales price cap** ties to the County’s Down Payment Assistance (DPA) program (currently **$345,000** per the DPA flyer). Verify caps **each year**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## How to Apply (Step 2 — County)

1. **Request application**: Email **AffordableHousing@ocfl.net**.  
2. **Questions / submission**: Housing & Community Development Division, **407-836-5150**.  
3. **Provide documentation** (typical): project summary, site location/sector confirmation, proposed rents or sales price, AMI compliance method, and draft legal instruments (e.g., LURA, deed restriction) as applicable for your path.  
4. **Expect monitoring requirements** and affordability periods to be part of the approval. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

## Required Legal/Compliance Instruments (by path)

- **Rental – Attainable**: **Developer’s Agreement + LURA**, 20-year term, annual monitoring. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Homeownership – Attainable**: **MOU or Developer Agreement**, 10-year term, submit **Closing Disclosure (CD)**. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Rental – Affordable**: **Developer’s Agreement + Deed Restriction and/or LURA**, 20-year term, annual monitoring. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **Homeownership – Affordable**: **Mortgage/Deed Restriction and/or LURA**, 10-year term, annual monitoring. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

## Common Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

- **Wrong sector/placetype** → Verify parcel is in **Targeted** or **Established** sector and allowed **place type** before you model rents/pricing. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Outdated AMI tables** → Use the **current** income limits for your application year. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Price cap mismatch (homeownership)** → Keep **sales price ≤ cap** (e.g., $345,000 per DPA flyer) and confirm annual updates. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- **Missing instruments** → Draft the **LURA/MOU/deed restriction** early; County approval hinges on enforceable affordability. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- **Assuming Step 2 is required** → **It’s optional**. You can use Ready Set Orange plans without certification, but you’ll miss incentives. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
